	WAITING_TABLE - Contains list of sites in an University to be crawled
	CRAWLED_TABLE - Contains list of sites in an University which have already been crawled
	TRACKS - contains the list of saved tracks from the crawled university

Algorithm:

crawler
{
	loop:
		Remove first URL from MAIN_TABLE
		do parsing
		loop:
			Remove first URL from WAITING_TABLE
			do parsing
			Place URL in CRAWLED_TABLE
		Put the main URL in CRAWLED_TABLE
}

parsing
{
	Get the XML document of URL and save the file
	Check if it contains TrackList
	if(present)
	{
			save all tracks with their details in the TRACKS table
	}
	Retrieve URLs in file and place it WAITING_TABLE
